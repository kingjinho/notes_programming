# Wrapper

- a.k.a adapter pattern
- These days, people often use wrapper
- Create a class that wraps another class
    - without modifying original class

## Why using wrapper?

1. Without modifying existing code
2. To add other functionality
3. When it does not meet our coding standard
4. To extend usage: encapsulate inner instance
    - DTO 

## Example: DirectX & OpenGL

- both uses graphic card
- offers almost same functionality

# Object Modeling

## Problems encountered when modeling
- No right answer
    - Subjective
    - Can't be right at first try
- `People try adding every state and action even if they are not necessary`
    - `Modify(add, remove) states and actions when they are necessary`
    - No perfect code
    - Be aware of when to stop

## In OO, Object has its own supervision

## Is being flexible(reuse) is always good?
- Not always
- To be more flexible, classes has to more separated
    - The more classes, the more complex

## However, before studying OOP, you must have the followings:
> Stick to basic, Concrete base
> 1. Code that is easy to read,
> 2. Code that is not error-prone,
> 3. Code that solves a problem,
> 4. Debugging

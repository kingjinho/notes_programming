# Necessity of OOP
## Problem 1: Procedural Programming
- Data not being humanized
- Error prone
- Provide struct(C language)
    - Create data type by grouping data
    - Limitation: `data and actions(methods) being separated`

`Is there way to combine Struct with actions in Language level??`

## Problem 2: How human see things in real life
- Do people separate data and actions? `NO`
- When we go to barber shop to get a haircut(action), we talk to `barber`
    - We do not talk to methods(actions)
- `People see the world as collection of an object`
    - Object not only includes states(data), but also actions(methods)
- However, not everything is an object(some has only data, and some has only actions)

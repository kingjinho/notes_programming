# OOP

- Paradigm
- An effort to see things as objects

# OOP Programming

- Sets of objects that interact
- Human based
- Think like human, not machine
    - `Very subjective`
    - `Also, the way human see things changes...`
- Q: is this not procedural?
    - A: It is, ultimately

# Subjectivity of an OOP

- It's been around for 70 years
- `Diverse` definition of an OOP
- `What people have read, what people have experienced and others all affect this subjectivity`

# What is an object?

- Object has states and actions that are related to each other
- In general, people perceive the world as `set of objects`

# Characteristics of OOP

1. Encapsulation
    - Put states and actions in object
    - Data hiding
        - Protect data from outside (other objects)
2. Inheritance
    - Create extended object based on existing object
    - Inherit base actions and states
    - Also, we can add others
    - `Practical: avoid duplicate code`
3. Polymorphism
    - `Same order(request), but act differently`
    - Late binding
    - Use of inheritance
4. Abstraction
    - a.k.a Data Abstraction
    - Generalization, not detailed
    - Data Abstraction
      - No need to know what exact data in an object
      - No direct access to data
    - Abstraction
      - Through polymorphism
      - Use of `abstract class and interface`
5. Association
   - One object use functionalities of other objects
   - `Divided into Aggregation and Composition`
6. Composition
   - Composite elements to create a new element
   - `Each element itself has no meaning`
   - Example: Auto parts in car
7. Aggregation
   - Gather elements to create a new element
   - `Each element itself has meaning`
   - Example: Students in College
      - They can go to another school when their college shut down

## Reuse

- Save us time
- Not 100% applicable
  - Can we predict future 100%?
- May reuse class, interface in wrong place
- Problem of having common sense? Subjective
- Reuse vs maintenance

## When to choose inheritance or composition?

both for reuse purpose

anything that can be made through composition, it can also be 
made in inheritance, vice versa

1. machine
   1. memory
      1. `when in inheritance, an object is allocated in a block of memory`
      2. `whereas composition can have blocks of memory`
      3. this can lead to performance issues
      4. `consider using inheritance`
         1. Bottleneck between memory and CPU(cache)
      5. `inheritance -> block to cache memory, if cache exists`
   2. allocate or release memory
      1. depends on language, but generally favor inheritance over composition
2. inheritance due to usage
3. efficient maintenance
   1. deep inheritance can be hard to maintain
4. other general case
   1. has-a? or is-a?

## ECS 

- Create an object without modifying existing code
- an example of an architecture pattern
- Using composition without re-compile

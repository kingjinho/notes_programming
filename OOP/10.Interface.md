# Interface

## User interface

- Text field
- Button
- Dropdown
- Switch

## Interface and function pointer

**be able to recall interface lecture**

- declaration of a function = function signature
- function signature = interface

## function pointer as a parameter vs class as a parameter

- function pointer as a parameter
    - accept any implementations
    - No unnecessary information

- class as a parameter
    - accept if it inherits parent
    - works like function pointer as a parameter
    - `However, unnecessary information comes with it`

## Interface is a pure abstract class

- Struct
    - collection of state
- class
    - collection of state and actions
- pure abstract class
    - `collection of actions without state`
    - this is an interface

## Interface
`pure abstract class that has no states, no methods implementation`
- No state
- No actual implementation
- only `public` method signature
- c header file
- all actions' signatures are public
- Why functions in interface should be public?
    - in abstract class, it can be protected
    - `Think of a definition of an interface`
    - Anyone can act on implementation
        - `having functions as protected sounds weird`

- Why allowing multiple interfaces, why not multiple classes?
    - having extends multiple classes can duplicate states and actions

## Why using interface

- as a function pointer
- mock multiple extension
- the key is `polymorphism`

## When to use decoupling

- Not a good idea for simple applications

## Disadvantage of decoupling

- not intuitive
- performance issues

# Interface

## User interface

- Text field
- Button
- Dropdown
- Switch

## Interface and function pointer

**be able to recall interface lecture**
- declaration of a function = function signature
- function signature = interface

## function pointer as a parameter vs class as a parameter

- function pointer as a parameter
    - accept any implementations
    - No unnecessary information

- class as a parameter
    - accept if it inherits parent
    - works like function pointer as a parameter  
    - `However, unnecessary information comes with it`
    
## Interface is a pure abstract class

- Struct
    - collection of state
- class
    - collection of state and actions
- pure abstract class
    - `collection of actions without state`
    - this is an interface

## Interface

- No state
- No actual implementation
- only signature
- Why functions in interface should be public?
    - in abstract class, it can be protected
    - `Think of a definition of an interface`
    - Anyone can act on implementation
        - `having functions as protected sounds weird`

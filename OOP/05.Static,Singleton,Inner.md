# Static
- Where does it belong to?
    - a class, not an object
    
- Static member, variable belongs to `class, not an object`
- non-static belongs to an object
- access from non-static to static: O 
- access from static to non-static: X

## Advantages of static in class over Global variable
- Confine access scope
- Avoid naming collision

## Critics from static
1. Everything should be an object!
2. Not well-thought-out
3. Using static is far from object-oriented
    - However, it's not wrong


# Design Pattern

- Abstraction of best practice
- A solution of problems that occurring frequently in architecting
- Reuse and flexibility, not quality

## Pros and Cons of Design pattern
1. Pros
    - Developing speed
    - Communication
2. Cons
    - misuse
    - Not a pattern if not applied immediately
        - just a guide
    - could be inefficient

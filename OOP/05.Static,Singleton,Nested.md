# Static

- Where does it belong to?
    - `a class, not an object`

- Static member, variable belongs to `class, not an object`
- non-static belongs to an object
- `access from non-static to static: O`
- `access from static to non-static: X`

## Advantages of static in class over Global variable

- Confine access scope
- Avoid naming collision

## Critics from static

1. Everything should be an object!
2. Not well-thought-out
3. Using static is far from object-oriented
    - However, it's not wrong

# Design Pattern

- Abstraction of best practice
- A solution of problems that occurring frequently in architecting
- Reuse and flexibility, not quality

## Pros and Cons of Design pattern

1. Pros
    - Developing speed
    - Communication
2. Cons
    - misuse
    - Not a pattern if not applied immediately
        - just a guide
    - can be inefficient

## Singleton

- Only one instance
- Be able to access globally
- Provide instance through static method


1. Singleton vs Static

- aren't these two same?
- Differences
    - Static cannot use polymorphism
    - Static cannot control instance creation
        - in Singleton, it is still complicated

2. Advanced Singleton

- What if it needs parameter?
    - Separate creation with retrieve
   ```java
        //initialization
        public static void createInstance(param1, param2) {
        
        }
        //providing
        public static A getInstance() {
        
        }
   ```

## Nested class

- a class within a class

```java
    public class Outer {
       public class Inner {

        }
    }
```
- non-static and static nested class
- non-static nested class
    - Java has it
    - inner class
    - `inner class can access to outer class's private member`
        - `whereas outer class cannot access to private member of inner class`
- static nested class
    - still can do the same thing as non-static nested class
    - not a static that we know(static member variable, static methods)
        - `this means it does not have automatic reference to outer class`

- These days, People don't use nested class

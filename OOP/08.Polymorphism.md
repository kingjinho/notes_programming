## Polymorphism

- an object can be transformed into various forms
  - object that has a reference to its parent
  > val variable: abstractType = Implementation()
- Same order but act differently based on objects
  - cat, dog object that inherits animal
- `Needs inheritance to implement polymorphism`

### Practical use case

- be able to store different types of objects
```kotlin

open class Animal {
    
} 

class Dog: Animal {
    
}

class Cat: Animal {
    
}

fun main() {
    val list = listOf<Animal>(Dog(), Cat())
    val animal: Animal = Dog()
}

```

# Class

## Why do we call class? & Why using class?

- Class in biology
    - Higher definition of species and family
- `Almost everything we see in real life has a class in which they are defined`
    - They share similar characteristics
    - So thus in programming

- Struct in C
- States + Action
- Follow the way people see things

## Class in OOP

- Template, Blueprint, Factory
- It includes states, actions and etc

## Class and memory

- `In Java, only primitive types are stored in stack`
- Class is actually `reference type`
    - `Thus, stored in Heap`

## Pointer VS Reference

- Reference type in Java is actually a Pointer
    - `Pointer is a variable that stores memory address`
- `Reference type in Java thus variable that stores memory address`

## Constructor

```kotlin
//instantiation and setting initial value
val human = Human()

human.sex = Sex.MALE
human.name = "Adam"
human.age = 20
```

- Problem with this
    - `Object does not have something meaningful during Instantiation`
- Why is this a problem?
    - Object is valid as soon as they are created
    - Error prone if not set in constructor
    - What if more member variables are added?
    - How should we set initial value?

## Notes

- `Constructor is a cotract that creates an object with right state`
- `Must ensure that object has right state when initializing`

## Access Modifier

- Object should be responsible for its own state
    - To do that, Object has to prevent modification from outside
- Access Modifier
    - Who from outside has access to my state?
        - public, protected, default, private
- How it is used?
    - member variable: private
    - method: public
    - `Access to member variable through method!`
        - Encapsulation
        - Abstraction
    - `method with private access modifier?`
        - to avoid code duplication
- Private access modifier
    - Access within `class`, not `object`
    - `Objects with same class can have access to private member`

```java
public class Human {
    private int age;
    ...

    public void punch(Human enemy) {
        enemy.age -= 1; //ok
        this.age += 2; //ok
    }
}
...
Human adam=new Human();
Humand james=new Human();
adam.punch(james)
```

# Class

## Why do we call class?

- Class in biology
  - Higher definition of species and family
- `Almost everything we see in real life has a class in which they are defined`
  - They share similar characteristics
  - So thus in programming


## Class in OOP
- Template, Blueprint, Factory
- It includes states, actions and etc

## Class and memory
- `In Java, only primitive types are stored in stack`
- Class is actually `reference type`
  - `Thus, stored in Heap`

## Pointer VS Reference
- Reference type in Java is actually a Pointer
  - `Pointer is a variable that stores memory address`
- `Reference type in Java thus variable that stores memory address`

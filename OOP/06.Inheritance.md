# Inheritance

- Many people think it's essential in OOP
- `Basis of polymorphism`
- Inheritance
    - inherit characteristic
    - `Create new classes(child or derived class) based on existing class(parent or base class)`
    - new class inherit states and actions
        - based on that new class can add new states and actions
    - is-a

## is-a

- Form of inheritance

## has-a

- Form of composition

## Inheritance vs Composition

- Both for reuse
- Inheritance can solve problem that can be done with Composition
    - The opposite is also available
    - `Pure technical perspective`
- `Choosing between inheritance and composition is essential`
    - `Using only one of them is not right`

## How to understand inheritance

1. based on generalization/specialization perspective
   - Classification
2. based on functional perspective
   - Have a base class contain base states and functionality and reuse

- These two approaches need some level of generalization

## Temporal Coupling
- methods call has to be in order
- easy to make mistake 

## Generalization of state
- What about time in second rather than dividing into hour, minute and second?
  - fewer number of states, less dependency
